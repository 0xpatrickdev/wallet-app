# Smart Wallet UI

## Development

The UI deps and scripts were bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

`yarn start` to start a local HMR server.

`yarn test` to run unit tests.

`yarn lint` to run static checks.

To test with a locally running network, see https://github.com/Agoric/dapp-inter/blob/main/README.md
